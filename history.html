                <h1>Show History</h1>
                <p>Newton &amp; Merry first teamed up in 2005 to write <span class="show">Apocalypse: The Musical</span>, which premiered at the Fitzpatrick Hall, Queens' College, Cambridge University in February 2005. Everyone involved had such a great time that the team decided to take <span class="show">Apocalypse</span> to the Edinburgh Fringe Festival that summer. <a href="http://www.feedtheducksproductions.com">Feed The Ducks Productions</a> was created, <span class="show">Apocalypse</span> was edited down to fit the 90 minute time slot and the show played for the full Fringe Festival run, receiving some fantastic reviews. As the summer ended, Newton &amp; Merry went their separate ways for post-graduate study in musical theatre at Goldsmiths College and the Royal Academy of Music respectively, before reuniting in 2007 to begin work on their latest project, <span class="show">HappyLand</span>.</p>

                <p>The first act of <span class="show">HappyLand</span> was performed at the George Wood Theatre, Goldsmiths College as part of a showcase of new musicals in production. The completed show premiered at the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 2008.</p>
